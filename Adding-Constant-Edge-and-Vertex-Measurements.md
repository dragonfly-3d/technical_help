# Adding Constant Edge and Vertex Measurements

If required, you can add a constant edge or vertex measurement to a graph. This can help reveal details that are obscured by edges and vertices with large radii.

The following example shows the advantage of applying a constant vertex radius measurement when evaluating a graph. You should note that the vertex radii can be further adjusted with the Vertex radius slider.

You can also add constant edge and vertex measurements in the Compute Measurements dialog (see [[Computing Measurements for Graphs|Computing Measurements for Graphs]]).

## Adding Constant Edge Measurements

You can add a constant edge measurement to a graph, which can facilitate the evaluation of some graphs. The name of the measurement and its value can be entered in the Name and Value dialogs, respectively.

## How to Add a Constant Edge Measurement

1. Right-click the required graph in the Data Properties and Settings panel and then choose **Add a Constant Edge Measurement** in the pop-up menu.
2. Enter a name for the measurement in the **Name** dialog.
3. Enter a value in the **Value** dialog.
4. Click **OK** the add the measurement.
