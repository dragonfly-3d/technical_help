  <h1>Analyzing Graph Tortuosity</h1>
  <p>---<br>title: "Analyzing Graph Tortuosity"<br>source<em>rel</em>html: "3D Modeling/Graphs/Analyzing Graph Tortuosity.htm"<br>---<br><h1>Analyzing Graph Tortuosity</h1><br><br>For graphs of porous media, you can analyze graph tortuosity and throat-weighted tortuosity between selected input and output boxes. You should note that tortuosity is a measure of the departure of a pore space from an ideal system made of straight and parallel capillaries and can be defined as the ratio of actual path length to the straight distance between the ends of the path. Throat-weighted tortuosity, which measures '<em>effective</em>' tortuosity, considers both path length and the '<em>difficultly</em>' of traversing different parts of the path based on the size of the cross-sectional areas within the passage.<br><br>Tortuosity analysis and throat-weighted analysis results — Mean, Min, Max, and STD — appear as shown below.<br><br>Tortuosity analysis results (left) and throat-weighted tortuosity analysis results (right)<br><br>!<a href="../../../<em>attachments/Resources/Images/3d-modeling/graphs/graph-tortuosity-analysis-results</em>_841e742420.png">Tortuosity analysis results</a><br><br><h2>How to Analyze Graph Tortuosity</h2><br><br>1. Add box shapes to define the input and output of the segment of the graph that you want to analyze (see [[Adding and Editing Shapes|Adding and Editing Shapes]]).<br><br>   You can adjust the input and output boxes on the 3D view showing the graph or to the 2D views of the original region of interest, as shown below.<br><br>   !<a href="../../../<em>attachments/Resources/Images/3d-modeling/graphs/graph-tortuosity-boxes</em>_ca16525c3b.png "Click to enlarge.""></a><br>2.
