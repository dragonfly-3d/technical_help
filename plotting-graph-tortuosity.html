  <h1>Plotting Graph Tortuosity</h1>
  <p>---<br>title: "Plotting Graph Tortuosity"<br>source<em>rel</em>html: "3D Modeling/Graphs/Plotting Graph Tortuosity.htm"<br>---<br><h1>Plotting Graph Tortuosity</h1><br><br>One of the quantities of interest in the flow through porous media is not the properties of the matrix, but rather the properties of the corresponding pore space. In particular, there may be narrow passages called pore throats separated by wider, winding passages. Reduced pore throats and increased tortuosity often result in increased capillary pressure and a reduction in permeability.<br><br>For analysis purposes, you can plot the distribution of graph tortuosity and throat-weighted tortuosity between input and output boxes. Tortuosity is a measure of the departure of a pore space from an ideal system made of straight and parallel capillaries and can be defined as the ratio of actual path length to the straight distance between the ends of the path. Throat-weighted tortuosity, which measures '<em>effective</em>' tortuosity, considers both path length and the '<em>difficultly</em>' of traversing different parts of the path based on the size of the cross-sectional areas within the passage.<br><br>Histograms of tortuosity and throat-weighted tortuosity<br><br>!<a href="../../../<em>attachments/Resources/Images/3d-modeling/graphs/tortuosity-histograms</em>_8d70c1b126.png "Click to enlarge."">Histograms of tortuosity</a><br><br>The tools at the top of the Histogram dialog let you to pan, zoom, and reset the histogram, as well as save the figure, adjust the figure, and export the histogram data to a comma-separated values file (\*.csv extension).<br><br>\<em>\</em>TABLE\<em>TOKEN\</em>1\<em>\</em><br><br><h2>How to Plot Graph Tortuosity</h2><br><br>1.
